We do not include the military equipment provided to NATO since this is not a direct flow into Ukraine (i.e. not a sovereign-to-sovereign flow). For the same reson, we do not include Luxembourg's contribution to the European funding of 250 million EUR, which refers probably to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (see ""Source of Aid 2"" and ""Source of Aid 3"" of the package from February 28).

The total value of the support package is € 120 million, of which € 45 million is designated for providing T-72 tanks. The first batch of tanks is expected to be delivered to Ukraine as early as next month. According to Source of aid 2 the government will not provide any further information about the content of this package. Source of Aid 3 states that the T-72 tanks come from Czech industry stocks, which is why we attribute 45 T-72 units, and not just the overhaul, to the Netherlands as bilateral aid, since the Netherlands bought the tanks from the Czech Republic, refurbished them, and donated them to Ukraine.

In September 2022, during an interview with Spiegel, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that Poland donated 300 tanks in total (Source of aid 2). Since Poland previously donated 240 T-72 tanks and yet an unknown amount of PT-91 Twardy, we assume, based on this statement, that the amount of PT-91 donated is 60. Later in February, Polish Prime Minister stated the different amount of tanks donated, which was ""250 tanks... or even more than that"" (Source of aid 3). Since there is no other official source, we have to rely on the most recent information, which is 250 total tanks provided in total. We also assume that ""even more"" could not refer to a critical amount and thus stick to 250. Therefore, we decrease the amount of PT-91 to 10 (250-240).
